3D printing in ECE
==================

Printing process
----------------

### Starkville campus

To print a 3D part, create a [new
issue](https://github.com/bjones1/MSU-ECE-3D-printing/issues/new/choose),
attaching your STL file(s) and drawing file(s) in a .zip folder to the issue.
The 3D printing team will then add labels to your issue as it progresses through
the print cycle:

1.  Needs processing: All new prints jobs have this label until the ECE printing
    team processes them.

2.  In progress: The ECE printing team is checking your design to make sure it
    will print correctly.

    *   Question: Further information is requested before the team can print
        your design.
    *   Invalid: The design can't be printed. Please revise it according to the
        comments provided.
3.  Queued: The design is in the print queue.

4.  Printing: The design is printing.

5.  Done: The print is complete. Please pick up your print, then close this
    issue.

To check on your print job, look at the
[issues](https://github.com/bjones1/MSU-ECE-3D-printing/issues).

Design process
--------------

We recommend using either [onShape](https://www.onshape.com/en/) (a web
application, no install needed) and
[Fusion360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview) (a desktop
application) to create your print. Both provide free, powerful CAD capabilities.

Available colors and materials
-------------------

### Starkville campus

Most projects will work perfectly when printed with either PLA or ABS material. The brand of the material does not really matter unless that manufacturer has a specific color you prefer over others. If strength or durability is a concern, please consult the wiki tab at the top of the page or contact one of the ECE MakerSpace student engineers. A list of colors currently in stock will be available below. (Keep in mind that requesting a specific color may delay your print if it is not stocked in the MakerSpace)
