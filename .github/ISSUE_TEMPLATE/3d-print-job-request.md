## Course/research group
(Foundations in ECE, Capstone Design I/II)

## Team ID

## Use case
(Letting us know how this is used helps us print more effectively. Is this cosmetic or structural? If structural, what axes are it loaded along? Will it be used outside, or in wet environments, meaning print with a different plastic?)

## Special instructions
(We print using PLA. Do you want a specific color, or multiple color? A different filament material, such as a fuzzy skin, or a rubber material? Add that here.)

## 2D CAD image
Attach a PNG/JPG image showing dimensions of your print with units (inches/cm) clearly visible.

## STL file
Attach your STL file to be printed. Upload this as a zip file.
